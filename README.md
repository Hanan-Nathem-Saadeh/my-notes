## ***introduction about myself :***
  My name is Hanan Nathem Jalal Saadeh , I am 30 years old, and I am living now in Zarqa, I studied Computer Science and Application at Hashimite University in 2013 with a 3.14 GPA.
  I'm a highly motivated , Strong, Ambitious and competitive, and I have a passion for continuous learning and development in addition to my high ability to absorb new concepts and find innovative solutions for them, and I have the ability to work individually and with a team, I want to develop my programming skills to find a good job.
## ***Learn the fundamentals of a good developer***
        The developers face many small factors that slowly harm their projects, Most of them only show long-term damage. And to avoid being a victim, the developer has to embrace the fundamental laws of software and develop a mindset that helps you make better decisions in programming. Here are some of the key points:
 1. Conceiving The Purpose of Software:

- Remember: the purpose of the software is not to show off how intelligent you are. — Max Kanat-Alexander, [Code Simplicity](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Simplicity-Fundamentals-Max-Kanat-Alexander-ebook/dp/B007NZU848).

2. Good enough is fine:

 instead of  writing code that isn’t needed,missing deadlines,be too generic and dealing with many bugs caused by the complexity,The incremental design should be your guide.
 -  Here is how you would use it to design a calculator:

    - Plan a system that does only addition and nothing else.
Implement it.
    - Improve the now-existing system’s design so you can add other operations also.
    - Plan subtraction and repeat step 2 and 3.
    - Plan multiplication and repeat step 2 and 3.
    - Plan division and repeat step 2 and 3.
3.  Simplicity.
4. Maintenance.
5. Consistency.
6. Resistance.
7. Picking Technologies (Tools, Libraries, etc.):

**There are a few factors you should consider before you start using some technology:**

- Is there active development behind it?
- Will it continue to be maintained?
- How easy is it to switch away from?
- What does the community say about it?
- If you can find the right answer these questions, you can reduce the risk of picking the wrong technology.
